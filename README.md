- Frontend dev server started successfully with Vite.
- Local URL came up on port `5174` when `5173` was occupied.
- Commits were pushed to `origin/feature1`.

## Local Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes and Limitations

- Browser speech recognition and synthesis depend on browser support and user microphone/speaker permissions.
- Final verification for spoken output/input is best confirmed manually in Chrome or Edge.
- If an external TTS provider fails or lacks credits, browser TTS still allows voice output without API key.

## Next Suggested Verification Checklist

1. Log out, then log in, and confirm one-time greeting plays on Home.
2. Open chatbot, click mic, speak, and confirm text appears and sends.
3. Keep Voice ON and confirm bot replies are spoken aloud.
4. Repeat once with Voice OFF to confirm no speech playback.
